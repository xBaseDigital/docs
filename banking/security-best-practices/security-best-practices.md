## Security Best Practices

This guide outlines essential security practices for interacting with the **XBD PAY Banking API** to ensure the safety of your API key pair, requests, and overall integration. Following these best practices helps protect your application and data from unauthorized access and potential threats.

## Key Management

Proper management of your API key pair (`keyId` and `apiSecret`) is critical for secure API authentication.

- **Store Private Keys Securely**:
  - Use environment variables or a key management system (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) to store your `apiSecret` (private key).
  - Avoid hardcoding keys in source code or configuration files.
- **Never Expose Private Keys in Client-Side Code**:
  - Ensure the `apiSecret` is only used in server-side environments to prevent exposure in browsers or client applications.
- **Rotate Keys Regularly**:
  - Periodically generate new API key pairs using the `/api/keys` endpoint to minimize the risk of key compromise.
- **Revoke Compromised Keys Immediately**:
  - If a key is suspected to be compromised, revoke it through the XBD PAY Merchant Dashboard or contact [support@xbdgroup.com](mailto:support@xbdgroup.com).

## Request Security

Secure your API requests to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.

- **Use HTTPS for All API Requests**:
  - Always use the secure endpoints:
  - HTTPS ensures encrypted communication between your application and the API.
- **Implement Request Replay Protection**:
  - Ensure timestamps are recent (e.g., within a 5-minute window).
- **Validate All Request Signatures Server-Side**:
  - Use the provided `keyId` and signature to verify requests on your server.
- **Log Authentication Attempts**:
  - Maintain logs of authentication attempts to monitor for suspicious activity and audit API usage.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling enhances security and prevents information leakage.

- **Donâ€™t Expose Detailed Error Messages to Clients**:
  - Return generic error messages (e.g., "Invalid Request") to clients to avoid revealing sensitive details about the API or server.
- **Implement Rate Limiting for Authentication Failures**:
  - Apply rate limits to endpoints like `/api/keys` or authentication endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- **Monitor for Unusual Authentication Patterns**:
  - Set up alerts for repeated failed authentication attempts or unusual request patterns to detect potential attacks early.
