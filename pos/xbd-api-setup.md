# Integrating checkout directly with our API

To integrate XBD Checkout into your store, follow these steps.

## Prerequisites

XBD will provide you with the following details necessary for order creation to function, which must be kept confidential on your side:

- [x] Pos Client ID
- [x] Pos Client Secret

Sandbox url : `https://pay-sandbox.xbase.digital/` <br />
Production url : `https://pay.xbase.digital/`

## Integration Steps

<strong>Step 1.</strong> Call the <strong>Token API</strong> to obtain access token to authenticate the further apis
Endpoint – <strong>identity/api/Authentication/connect/token</strong>

Method – <strong>`POST`</strong>

```json
{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "{POS Client Id which you received from XBD}",
  "client_secret": " {POS Client Secret which you received from XBD}"
}
```

The above api will return access token which is needed for further api to function

<strong>Step 2.</strong> Call the <strong>Authorise API</strong> to create an order on XBD System
Endpoint – `api/orders/authorize`

Method – <strong>`PUT`</strong>

```json
"header" : {
  "Content-Type" : "application/json"
  "Authorization" : "Bearer {access_token from Step 1}"
}
```

```json
{
  "merchantLocationId": "{Merchant Location ID provided by XBD}",
  "merchantOrderId": "{Order ID generated by your system}",
  "title": "{Your Business Name}",
  "description": "{Description of the Cart}",
  "amount": "{Cart Amount}",
  "currency": "{Currency of the Cart}",
  "email": "{Customer Email ID}",
  "acceptUrl": "{Your Accept URL}",
  "cancelUrl": "{Your Cancel URL}",
  "callbackUrl": "{Your Callback URL}"
}
```

You will receive a <strong>paymentRedirectUrl</strong> in the response, which you need to redirect the user to.

With this <strong>paymentRedirectUrl</strong>, your store will be navigated to our Checkout solution which will further process the order and receive the payment.
